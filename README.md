# Task Manager (Python CLI Application)

A simple and lightweight Task Manager built using Python.  
This project helps users add, edit, delete, and manage everyday tasks using a clean command-line interface.  
All data is saved locally using JSON, so your tasks remain safe even after restarting the program.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new tasks with title, description, due date, and priority  
- View all tasks  
- View only completed or pending tasks  
- Filter tasks by priority  
- Edit task details  
- Delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Persistent storage using `data/tasks.json`

## 🧪 Testing Approach

Testing was performed manually by verifying each feature step-by-step:
-Added multiple tasks and confirmed they appeared correctly
-Attempted invalid input to ensure error handling works
-Edited task details and verified updates in the JSON file
-Restarted program to confirm persistent storage
-Tested all viewing filters (pending, completed, priority)
-Deleted tasks and checked if data synced properly

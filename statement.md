# Project Statement  
### Task Manager Application

## 📌 Project Title  
**Task Manager (Python Command-Line Application)**

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Many students and working individuals struggle to keep track of their tasks, deadlines, and priorities in an organized way. Most existing task management tools are either too complex or have unnecessary features that make them difficult to use for simple daily planning. To address this, the project aims to build a lightweight and beginner-friendly Task Manager using Python that runs completely through the command line.  
The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and view tasks easily, while storing all data locally using a JSON file for persistence.

## 📌 Scope of the Project  
The scope of this project includes designing and developing a modular Python-based Task Manager with the following capabilities:

- Create tasks with title, description, due date, and priority.  
- View tasks based on different categories (all, pending, completed, by priority).  
- Edit an existing task’s details.  
- Delete tasks by ID.  
- Mark tasks as completed.  
- Ensure tasks remain saved even after the program is closed, via JSON storage.  

Future enhancements may include adding a GUI, user authentication, advanced filtering features, reminders, and exporting options.

## 📌 Objective  
The objective of the project is to build a simple yet powerful command-line tool to improve productivity and help users organize their daily activities. Additionally, the project aims to give hands-on understanding of Python concepts such as object-oriented programming, file handling, JSON serialization, and modular design.

## 📌 Conclusion  
The Task Manager project successfully demonstrates how a simple Python application can help users stay organized while also showcasing important programming concepts. The system is easy to use, fast to run, and flexible enough for future upgrades. It serves as both a practical productivity tool and an excellent learning experience in Python software development.
